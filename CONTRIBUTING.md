## Prerequisites

Open a terminal/command prompt and use the following command: `npm install` in the Fluent folder.

## Development

Run the `dev` script with: `npm run dev`.  
This will watch for changes inside the `/src` folder and then auto compile them into your BetterDiscord themes folder.

## Deploying

Simply push your changes to the `main` branch and make a pull request.  
If all is well you PR will be accepted and merged with the `main` branch.

This will then trigger an action to compile the `/src/_base.css` to the `deploy` branch.
