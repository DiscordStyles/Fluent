## PD
This is a little fork by me, xsm2, to fix and modify a few things, all the credit should go to [Gibbu](https://github.com/Gibbu)/[DiscordStyles](https://github.com/DiscordStyles). If you want to see the changes just look at the commits, but the most important ones are:

- Less padding/margins in general
- Disabled seflmessages addon(so no more messages on the right)
- Moved Minimize, Maximize and Close buttons to the Toolbar (Thanks to [doggybootsy](https://github.com/doggybootsy/FluentCord) for the ""inspiration""(aka the code))
